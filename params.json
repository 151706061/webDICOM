Following features will be implemented:\r\n- Loading and displaying DICOM images by specifying files or a directory\r\n- Scrolling through the images\r\n- Changing the windowing function\r\n- Zoom\r\n- Move\r\n- Panning \r\n- Gallery view as a ribbon on the bottom\r\n- Displaying patient information in the corners\r\n- 3D view with webGL\r\n\r\n\r\n## Visualization\r\nThe visualisation of DICOM images is done with HTML5 <canvas> and WebGL. \r\n\r\n## Browser support\r\nAny WebGL and HTML5 enabled browser should work. Tested with Chrome, Firefox and Safari (Mac OS X). But best performance and user expierence with Google Chrome v25.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\nThere is still work in progress, but basic functionality is in place. TODOs include:\r\n- compressed DICOMs (JPEG, JPEG2000, JPEG-LS)\r\n- WebGL visualisation\r\n- Patient data\r\n- Gallery view\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
