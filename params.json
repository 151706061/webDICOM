The files are then parsed and sorted by patient's name & \r\nseries description and viewed in a tree view. By clicking on a series, the images are displayed in the viewer.\r\n\r\n##Visualization\r\nThe visualisation of DICOM images is done with the HTML5 <canvas> element. \r\n\r\n##Browser support\r\nBest performance and user expierence with Google Chrome. HTML5 Upload Folder (webkitdirectory) works only with Chrome. \r\nOther browsers accept multiple files.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\nThere is still work in progress, but basic functionality is in place. TODOs include:\r\n- compressed DICOMs (JPEG, JPEG2000, JPEG-LS)\r\n- WebGL visualisation\r\n- Gallery view\r\n\r\n##Demo\r\n[Here](http://mi-kas.github.com/webDICOM/demo/index.html)","google":"UA-39899942-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
